### Problem Statement:

Across the world, COVID-19 cases are constantly fluctuating, often influenced and shaped by public policy, community sentiment and other external factors. The United States   of America has seen some of the wildest changes globally, and understanding its inputs requires a deep analysis into the drivers of the infection rate on the local, state and federal level.The goal is to develop an algorithm that will predict the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States of America, between 27 July to 15 August.The dataset I have considered is the USA dataset as train set from January 21st - July 25th and WHO COVID 19 dataset as test set which have COVID cases from Feb 24th - July 25th.

### Dataset Information:

The USA dataset contains the following features
  -> date
  -> county
  -> state
  -> fips
  -> cases
  -> deaths
  -> region

WHO COVID 19 Dataset contains the follwing features:
  -> date
  -> country_code 
  -> country
  -> WHO region
  -> new cases
  -> cases
  -> new deaths
  -> cumulative deaths


US STATS ABOUT COVID-19: With around 5 million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about a quarter of the global total. The situation got really bad in late March but by May, cases were declining and most states had begun to ease restrictions put into place to halt the spread of the virus.

The goal of the project is to develop a predictive algorithm to predict the number of positive cases in the US between 7/27/20 - 8/15/20.
